# Calculator

A calculator made for a school project. The calculator works solely in the console and is able to to do the following calculations: <br/>
Addtion <br/>
Subtraction <br/>
Multiplying <br/>
Division <br/>
Percentage <br/>
Sine <br/>
Cosine <br/>
Tangent <br/>
Square root <br/>
Logarithm <br/>
Exponent <br/>

The program starts by showing the different formulas that can be used and chosen. Once the formula is chosen, the program proceeds with asking the user for numbers of which the calculations are made. After the program has finished calculating, the user can choose to continue to calculate by choosing one of the formulas or to end the program.
